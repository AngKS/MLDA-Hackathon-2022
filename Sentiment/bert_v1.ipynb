      "text/plain": "[\"I wanted to find some comfortable cotton socks that were organic, sweatshop-free and fair-trade (or the equivalent) and ended up buying several pairs from both Maggies and Pact. The bottom line is that Id buy both kinds again but the Pact socks are more comfortable and I think a better product overall. In future Id probably choose Pact for their colored socks and then Maggies for their natural (unbleached) crew socks (Pact doesnt make white/unbleached crews).\\n\\nIve come to the conclusion that the sizes listed for Maggies socks are womens sizes. So if you're a man, then consider that size 9-11 for women is equivalent to 7.5-9.5 for men. Their size 10-13 socks are pretty snug on my size 9 feet. People have said that they shrink upon washing  I use a cool setting on the washer and haven't had this issue. The socks are a bit more rustic compared to Pacts socks but they do feel very natural and my feet like them :) In other words, they are slightly rougher in feel and not quite as polished in their construction, or as elastic, but they are comfortable and nicely breathable. Three years later, only about two pairs out of the six are still useable (i.e. no holes in the heel), which is probably not bad in terms of longevity.\\n\\nMaggies cotton is organically farmed and their older products are Fair Trade certified, although they are switching to an alternative program called Free2work due to the red tape in Fair Trade inspections and paperwork. I would say that the main issue from sustainability standpoint is whether you want to buy cotton socks or go with an alternative fiber. If you are going to go with cotton then theres really a world of difference between organic and conventional, since the non-organic cotton is one of the most pesticide-intensive crops out there (accounting for 25% of the worlds insecticide use, and nasty ones too), with run-off into rivers and water supplies. Whether organically farmed or not, cotton farming is water-intensive and also requires a lot of land.\\n\\nGetting back to alternatives to cotton Theres a big increase in clothing made bamboo, usually listed as viscose from bamboo (e.g., Footprint socks, which I intend to try). Most people are in agreement that bamboo is way more eco-friendly to grow than cotton; the issue here is how the bamboo is converted to the viscose fiber. All of the bamboo-viscose in the world is made by the Hebei Jigao Chemical Fiber Company from their organic bamboo plantations (they own the patent for the process). The bamboo leaves and pith are deconstructed in sodium hydroxide and then extruded into a solvent (carbon disulfide, Ive read); a process that can be benign or harmful to the environment depending on how good their wastewater treatment is. An importer from San Francisco visited the plant and said their wastewater treatment facility is good but it would be better if their factory was a closed loop system (see article Bamboo Boom). Their bamboo-viscose now has a Confidence in Textiles certification (Oeko-Tex Standard 100) which means that the material is free of harmful chemicals, but doesnt exclude the possibility of pollution at the factory site. Bamboo linen may be the next phase in bamboo textiles  this involves a process similar to that of making linen from flax or hemp. Overall, I think bamboo is a very promising material and perhaps the best alternative to cotton. There are also some hemp/cotton socks out there (I haven't seen any pure hemp), and in some cases they are made from organically grown hemp and cotton (e.g Raworganique). Theres wool of course too, but Ill leave that debate for another review!\\n\\nSo, overall Ill give it 4 stars gold stars for quality of the product and 4 green stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it. In terms of sustainability they are doing well, but I think there is still some room for improvement; Pact does a better job at reducing their carbon footprint (sockprint, ho ho), and also bamboo is overall a more sustainable material than cotton.\",\n 'The quality of the construction of these pants are great.....just that the waist size is not true to the label sizing.

My car is running great and am hopeful about the other two bottles I have as one is going in my fathers truck he left me and the other I'm saving for when/if it's really needed. I have ran STP cleaner through it previously pretty regular which might be the reason it isn't really cleaning much else out.\",\n \"Great quality, genuine product here.

I have owned 2 dryers and 1 Avanti Washer, and all three broken within 1.5 years. Obviously right after the 1 year warranty. The reliability is the biggest problem with the machines. The problem was a \"burned\" motor, so it made to point to fix it - as it would cost as a new machine. Avanti should extend the warranty or make their products better',\n 'I am adding additional comments after 3 years of use:\\n===\\nI bought this set 3 years ago and gave a rave review a few months after.\\nHowever, after three years of use, the small lid that stays on top of the pressure valve is broken. Luckily, I can still use the pressure cooker, but it does not look good anymore without the lid. Plastic parts have been used to keep the lid on top and after 2 years they broke off. They should have used more durable parts on such an expensive model.\\nThere is another problem that I have gotten around: it is very difficult to cook certain grains, such as peeled lentils, or Indian \"daals\"; bad stuff comes out after pressure is reached.\\nI let the stuff get to a boil, lower the heat and then put the top on. That works most of the time.\\n========================\\nInitial Review:\\nWe looked at reviews here before we bought our set. Some people were not satisfied with the smaller cooker because either it was deemed too small or its handle was thought to be too close to the fire for comfort.\\nAfter using both cookers for about a month, we have found that both work very well. We are a small family of four, and we are finding that the smaller cooker is more useful to us. We just follow instructions and use it on a medium-size burner.\\nOne caveat though is that the cookers are not useful in cooking soft grains such as some pulses (such as Indian \"daals\" such as Arahar/Moong etc). They tend to clog up the \"whistle\".  But it seems that the cooker still remains safe to use. To Kuhn Rikon\\'s credit, they do point out this limitation in the manual.',\n 'I have been using this for years.  I have purchased it at stores.  I should have listened to some of the reviews here.

Also, the hair wraps around the small \"glider\" wheels and is nearly impossible to remove.\\n\\nThe price is low and you get what you pay for (if you\\'re lucky).',\n 'Whatever Microsoft.  No other processor choices.  They monopolize the market and get away with it.',\n 'Overall the product was made well.  It has a nicely finished base and the blade arrived sharper than I would expect for a $20 tool.  However, there is a mismatch between the depth adjustment knobs and the blade.  I needed to grind the blade (not the sharpened end) to create enough clearance for the adjustment knobs to move properly.  Although this is an easy fix, it should not be necessary on a brand new tool.',\n 'This one save allot till now, conected to a simple Zoom H1 I can go wherever I want to go and serve his purpose really good.

Do not waste your money on this.\",\n \"The Eureka Mighty Mite is my new favorite. It is great for hard surfaces and for furniture and blinds. It is also good for a quick pick up on carpet. We have two black labs and the Mighty Might sucks up dog hair like nobody's business. One of the best things about this little vac is its size. It is so easy and light to carry around that I rarely put it down and the 20' cord gives you good range. It has excellent suction and the the noise level is reasonable. This is a simple and effective little unit that has everything you need and nothing you don't. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is that I have only owned it for about a month and don't yet know how durable it will be.\",\n 'Great',\n 'was going to expire',\n \"I couldn't find one of these in any of the local or big box stores I went to.

It is very clear and even the people I call tell me they can hear me clearer than they can hear most people!',\n \"don't like the fit\",\n \"I disagree with the other reviewers. This is a cheap child's toy. Buy a regular hard disc if you want to throw it far. It's too lightweight to get any real distance. It does have a nice soft border but that is probably the only thing going for it. Great for a dog, but no distance champion.

I\\'m downgrading my rating from 5 stars to 2 because of non-functioning DVI support for recent 700 - 900 series Nvidia cards. It is now the biggest paper weight I\\'ve ever owned.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nUPDATE July 2015: I\\'ve upgraded to a 980ti graphics card. Nvidia graphics drivers are all showing problems with DVI-only displays, as the graphics driver update makes the screen to go black (actually turns the monitor off and if there is a HDMI monitor connected as a second screen, that would be the only display that is working). I\\'ve back-tracked to previous versions of graphics drivers at the cost of optimized gaming support just so that I could use this monitor, but in the end, when I upgraded to a 980ti, there was no old-enough driver with a properly working support for a DVI display. The monitor works fine, but with the newer graphics driver installation, the display is disabled or powered down. Posting this as a \"Buyers Beware\" message, as the monitor is an amazing monitor, but you better have a 780 level graphics card with old enough drivers to safely display images on this monitor. Newer drivers are a no-go, and I tried a brute-force trial-and-error testing on all drivers from Nvidia for the two cards that I used. So this isn\\'t an opinion, it\\'s a fact.\\n\\nI instead recommend a newer version from this company that supports not only DVI, but also HDMI and DisplayPort as well.\\n=============================================================\\nI\\'ve been using a 1080p monitor for a long time. It\\'s a 26-inch Samsung TV/monitor combo. I found out about these Korean imports last fall and have been fidgeting like a kid who has just enough money to buy one toy but can\\'t decide to actually buy because he\\'s not sure if it would be worth his money. When I took the plunge, I decided to pay a tad bit more and get the perfect pixel version. There also was a HDMI/display port/DVI multi-output version that asked slightly more on top of the perfect pixel price, but since my purpose for this monitor is strictly to game using my GTX780, I ordered this version.\\n\\nArrival: very fast and efficient, especially considering I ordered it during the snow-maggedon of North America few weeks back, and it still arrived in less than a week\\'s time from the moment I clicked purchase to the moment I took my phone out and snapped a celebratory picture in my living room.\\n\\nQuality: No dead pixel, as promised. Screen was much brighter than my 3 year-old Samsung 1080p, but I decided to stick with default setting after playing around using the NVidia desktop because it\\'s a non-glossy screen and I have it positioned in the room where it gets some sunlight during the day. There are some buttons underneath the screen towards the right edge, but only the power button seems to function, but I already knew this would be all I need, per product description page.\\n\\nDesign: Very nice. Big. Tempered glass stand which is well secured to the monitor and adds a bit of luxuriousness to it.\\n\\nPerformance: I\\'ve tried 2560x1600 on the following games so far, and I\\'ve been (figuratively) spasming non-stop from the constant eye-gasm: (surprisingly FRAPS kept showing upper 50s or steady 60fps even at this resolution with max settings on most - try different AA settings and filters yourself for proof)\\n(My PC setting - i7 2600, 8GB RAM, GTX780 SC version, Sound Blaster Z)\\n- Assassin\\'s Creed series\\n- Dead Space series\\n- Crysis series (Holy Chimpanzee... so gorgeous)\\n- Metro series (Last Light starts out fine at 60fps but starts to act ... well, haunted, sometimes going down to 17fps, then I just reload the save and keep playing)\\n- Skyrim (RealVision enb with atmospheric preset + over 60 performance heavy game / graphics mods, and still 60fps)\\n- Castlevania Lords of Shadow (this game is beautiful at this resolution)\\n- And some others which I can\\'t remember\\nToday I\\'ll probably try SweetFx on Borderlands 2 and see how pretty it looks at this resolution. I still have 17 more games to test out.\\n\\nVerdict: I was mentally preparing myself for an eventual mobo purchase so that I could SLI with another GTX780, but that was an amateurish thought as my PC gaming guru friend explained to me. If you have the same setup as mine, GTX780 (not even TI), 2560x1600 gaming will be played at max / ultra (whichever the highest) settings for most games out there. (see my Crysis reference, I meant all three games). SLI may be necessary only if you plan on doing a 4K display.

But he can also be down right boring.  I don't think anybody in the game has as much of a broad span as Warren.  This is mainly because hes good tracks are absolutely great.  Cant You Feel It is a dead set stand out on this album.  The thick bass line is so spine tingly and so much so digs into your soul and pumps your heart with so much love.  However there are 3 other tracks on the album that would sit nicely in a greatest hits collection but the rest are just a waste of time listening to.  Smokin Me Out is one of the 3 naturally enough.  It has bounce and the other 2 lesser tracks are Young Fun and Back Up.  I shot the sherriff is a joke and I don't know why people love this.

It was difficult to put the batteries in and when I did the item did not work at all.',\n \"I hate to give bad reviews but I feel this one is deserved. At first, I was pretty excited to find a decent quality cat food that didn't cost half a paycheck for the large bag. My 3 cats, who are anything but picky eaters, were ALL OVER this food for about 7-8 months. They were slimming down, their coats looked shiny and lustrous, their BMs were a little less offensive... It was the best quality *affordable* cat food I'd ever found.\\n\\nThen, about halfway through the last bag I purchased, they just stopped eating it. Like I said, they aren't exactly picky eaters and it's not like I abruptly switched foods on them. I noticed the rest of the bag started to develop a funky, stale smell and that was the end of it, they avoided it like the plague. I dumped the rest and bought a new bag. The same thing happened after about a week. I stored it inside an airtight bin the same way I always had, so I'm not sure why it seemed to go stale all of a sudden. To make sure the recipe hadn't changed, I checked the ingredients against an old empty bag I saved for dumping litter and everything was the same except for the design on the front, which was slightly different. I don't know if they changed the type of packaging which is causing it to not stay fresh as long, or what. But I tried one more time with the smallest size bag just to be sure it wasn't a weird coincidence. Surely enough, after a few days to a week of being opened, the remainder of the food went funky/stale and they wouldn't go near it.\\n\\nMy experience with Evolve dry cat food was such a let down since it started out so positive. So far, I've only found one other review complaining about it going stale but that was when they first started buying it, not after 7-8 months of having no issues with it like me, so I'm baffled. The majority of cats and their lowly human servants seem to have better luck with this food which makes my experience seem like an isolated incident, all the more reason to feel bad about about giving it a low rating, but I have to be honest. The one positive thing I can say is that I haven't yet had a problem with the wet food, which they still enjoy, but I regret to say I won't be dumping anymore money into kibble that seems to go bad almost immediately after opening it...\",\n 'The dye was easy to use and went on perfectly but, faded after 1 wash.',\n 'I got this about a year ago, needing to loan my better\\nAT&T box to my inlaws.\\nThis works \"ok\" for simply getting messages, when I\\'m in\\nthe house.

Honestly, this is the first time I'll ever be returning anything I've purchased on here. I saw that there were quite a few bad reviews for this product but decided to take a chance anyway because of one reviewer saying it 'works great for mac'. and since belkins does make alot of good mac products I gave it a try. unfortunately I'm guessing it doesn't work for a PC or Mac seeing as, when I connected more than one usb device, a screen popped up saying that, there was not enough power to support the usb device. the funny thing is, the belkins USB 4-Port Hub has a power pack and still couldn't function supporting more than one USB device at a time. I thought who knows, it could be my computer but some USB devices like my iMic didn't even work at all, when connected to this product. so whats the use of having a USB hub if half the stuff you plug in won't work. I want to buy another one but Im not going to feel too happy if I just end up returning a more expensive one since alot of these hubs seem to have bad feedback.

My only 'wish' would be that they would cut off the stem before drying as I just want to plop one in my mouth and eat it all the way, without having to stop and bite off the stem and spit it out. So, now I go through and cut out each stem before putting in my baggie to take to work, and that's something I really didn't want to have to do.\\nThey are delicious and I love them, and it's not a big deal in the scheme of things to do that, but I did feel it was worth mentioning, especially if you have children and you certainly don't want them to choke on it, as I almost did.\",\n 'I like the detachable handles a lot.',\n 'Tried to load this on 3 different machines each running a different OS.

None of the missions ever really sparked my interest, and I beat all of the story missions in two days. The additional Instant Action missions seemed thrown together and a waste of time. Guns seemed unrealistic, and they all basically did the same thing. I used little tactics beyond run in and kill all the enemies, or snipe them from a distance. Team commands were sometimes difficult to issue, and Lonestar would not always follow my commands well. I was uninterested in the story and action, and that is why I have rated this game poorly. The game simply does not compare to Siphon Filter- Dark Mirror, which is an excellent FPS.

I was just learning to ski and\\nhad a friend on the ski patrol....',\n 'I know it\\'s Robin Trower but not the Trower before this album. For the first time I hear more pop than blues in his songs. Passion peaked at #100 on the album charts, not real good, but a considerable improvement, at least on the charts, than his previous album, Back It Up (#191). On this album Trower had once again changed his lead vocalist, this time it\\'s Dave Pattison who sounds somewhat like James Dewar but without the soulful quality that he possessed.\\n\\nThe album opens with \"Caroline\" which is one of the most pop sounding songs Trower has recorded in his solo career. There are even background vocals in the song which is unusual for his songs. \"Secret Doors\" follows, it\\'s more like Trower but not quite like Trower\\'s other rock songs. \"If Forever\" is a slow tempo song & reminds me of Hendrix when he would do a slow song. \"Won\\'t Think About You\" speeds up the tempo, sounds a little funky but has some pop in it too which is so unlike Trower. Next comes the title song \"Passion\", once again more pop than blues. It also has some background vocals. The song reminds me of another group but I can\\'t name them (Toto?). Maybe I shouldn\\'t call so much of this pop but it\\'s certainly more radio-friendly than almost everything that Trower has ever done. \"No Time\" is really the first song that reminds me of the old Trower. It\\'s blues based, no more than mid-tempo, Trower finally shows off some of his chops reminding us just how good he is. \"No Time\" is probably the best song on the album, this is the first song on the album where I hear Trower\\'s trademark wah-pedal put to use, something he used to employ on many of his songs. The instrumental \"Night\" follows & is the next best song on the album. It\\'s a slow tempo song that has some synthesizers in it, another un-Trower-like sound. Trower gives a very tasteful & somewhat restrained lead with a slight hint of fuzz. \"Night\" is somewhat of a crossbreed of Trower & Pink Floyd, the closeout lead definitely reminds of David Gilmour. \"Bad Time\" reminds me of the material that Trower recorded on the two albums he had Jack Bruce doing vocals & bass. This song also features multi guitars layered together, this is certainly a Trower trademark of his earlier material. The album closes with \"One More Word\" which also has un-Trower-like background vocals but there\\'s a good solo in the middle.\\n\\nThis is definitely a different, some might say updated, Trower effort. This is Pattison\\'s first vocal effort for Trower & not his last. This was the second album that had James Bronze on bass. But, unlike the previous album, Back It Up, Bronze has co-written most of the songs with Trower. I\\'m sure that Trower took the more radio-friendly songs route intentionally. The addition of Pattison & Bronze\\'s co-writing probably had a lot to do with this. It\\'s not a bad Trower album, it\\'s stands well with almost everything else he had done up to this point but it\\'s not the same style. I think most Trower fans will still enjoy this album, just be aware that it IS different.',\n \"I agree with another critical reviewer that the on-screen part of this package isn't particularly well-organized.  I did find the audio CDs helpful--went through the 20 lessons on all 4 CDS in about 3 months driving to school and back.  But then what?  I looked for a Berlitz package that would continue with lesson 21 and forward, but apparently there isn't any.  I wrote to Berlitz customer service (which seems oriented toward expensive private or small group instruction), and didn't even get an answer.  I'm going to try Rosetta Stone next.  We'll see.\\n\\nOh, and another thing: it would have been helpful if there had been an a written translation of the audio CDS somewhere in the package.  Sometimes there's a word I just don't get in the audio version and there's no way to find out what that word is.\\n\\nLastly, notice that this might not even be a Berlitz product--it may be that the name has been licensed by another software company.  Not that this makes it better or worse.  My feeling is that Berlitz itself may need to readdress its own mission.  At one point in time there may have been no great alternative to in-person instruction, but these days the vast majority of language learners are probably going to learn with a computer program, at least through intermediate levels of language learning, and Berlitz really hasn't addressed that.

It is well written and well organized. The objective of the book, which is to stress that Christian salvation includes accepting Jesus as Lord, not just Savior, was soundly presented logically and scripturally. I should disclose that I was raised evangelical fundamentalist and was called to convert to Roman Catholic while in graduate school (27 years ago).\\n\\nBaptists, adherents to the Dallas Theological Seminary, and Presbyterians would be the Christians who found the message in this book most agreeable. Other evangelical fundamentalists would follow as a close second.\\n\\nHere are the primary issues I had with the book:\\n1) The Gospel According to Jesus was actually the interpretation of the good news by John Macarthur. It was clear that he interpreted the Scriptures from a pre-set paradigm. He conveniently omitted Jesus\\' statements and parables and other scriptures that would oppose what he stated as fact. His push for the ideas of eternal security and that everyone who is saved will have the same amount of eternal life were distracting from his main premise.\\n2) Although he is espousing an early Church teaching, which was rejected by Luther and some others during the Reformation, he subtly emphasizes his separation from Orthodox and Roman Catholic teachings, even taking some not-so-subtle jabs at what he believes they teach and citing anti-Catholic anecdotes without the full historical context. I found it interesting that some of statements which were presented as profound read as though they were directly from the Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church. Despite failings of all denominations, we should be one as Jesus and the Father are one. Sin separates and love unites. I found the book pushing toward separation instead of unity within the universal Body of Christ on earth. I prefer adherence to the 16th century Latin statement \"In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas \" or \"in necessary things unity, in doubtful things liberty, in all things charity\".\\n3) There are several historical errors, such as the claim that soldiers were paid a denarius per day. A denarius was the standard wage for a day laborer and Roman soldiers were paid 225 denarii per year with deductions for food and clothing, which net them about 10 denarii per month.\\n\\nAlthough I disagreed with portions of his approach and portions of his theology, the book was thought provoking and an excellent argument for Lordship salvation. I recommend it with the caveat to focus on the central premise and to avoid distraction from the gem it holds by becoming bogged down in the minor theological points he includes.',\n 'The \"clear\" button on my calculator does not work AT ALL.

Basically, the Psychedelic Furs keep their post-punk/new wave sound, still including the saxophone, which, unlike their prior album, sometimes detracts from the songs.\\n\\nMy favorite tracks on this album are \"Pretty in Pink\" (I didn\\'t care for the movie), \"Mr. Jones\" and \"Into You Like a Train.\"  I\\'ve read the lyrics to \"Pretty in Pink\" many times, and think it might be about a woman named Caroline who has committed suicide and is dressed in pink in an open casket.  Her past lovers, in attendance at her funeral, are reminiscing about her (\"and wasn\\'t she easy and isn\\'t she pretty in pink\").

I played roughly 8 hours of this game and put it down, unable to take any more of it. This game consists of bland, lifeless graphics, an awful lot of running around in large open areas, little action in terms of combat, and little in the way of dialog or story. Actually, it\\'s hard to see what this game has going for it at all.\\n\\nThe inventory system in this game is incredibly annoying. Your inventory starts weighing you down after picking up only a few guns. As a result, the game saps your endurance quite fast, effectively slowing you down to a crawl. If you\\'ve played Neverwinter Nights, the concept is similar to how in that game loot made you become encumbered, except in this game this happens absurdly quickly. Now consider the fact that you have vast distances to cover between each objective or scene in the game, and you should quickly realize what an incredible annoyance this can be.\\n\\nDue to this and a few other factors, the large open areas in this game as opposed to the comparatively linear level design of games like Half-Life and Half-Life 2 result in a whole lot of time spent running around, and a lot less time spent in dialog scenes or combat. Some games manage to pull off having a bigger and more open game environment. Unfortunately, this isn\\'t one of them.\\n\\nIf you want a good shooter game, steer clear of this. Go play anything from the Half-Life series. Any of the Half-Life games are outstanding examples of FPS excellence. They all have an interesting story, setting, and keep you interested all the way through to the very end and beyond with gut-wrenching action, flawless gameplay, and intriguing storylines.\\n\\nIf you want a good shooter-RPG, Mass Effect and Bioshock have this game beaten by miles. They contain infinitely more interesting storylines, far more interesting action and dialog, and the graphics are stunningly realistic with vibrant colors as opposed to the kind of blocky and bland offering STALKER serves up.\\n\\nHonestly, I\\'d rather be re-playing Mass Effect, Bioshock, or the Half-Life series than play this game, despite the fact that I\\'ve already played these games several times over now.

The forehead area fits OK but the area around the cheeks form pretty much a 90 degree angle.  This results in an uncomfortable fit AND it sticks out about an inch and half from the tip of my nose.  Perhaps they shaped this without the thick foam padding which would have been a better fit.\\n\\nDisregarding the issue with the fit, the protection is decent.  Basketball is my sport and I generally play point guard.  Vision is not a problem...I've read reviews that people complained about not being able to see but they might be expecting miracles or something only a custom fitted mask would provide.  The clear plastic allows you to see in front of you.  The padding below and above does restrict the a little bit but it's worth sacrificing for the protection.\\n\\nThere are 2 issues going back to the mask...to get it to stay as close to the face as possible, I adjust the straps so it's relatively tight to my face.  After a while, it gets pretty uncomfortable and hurts a little on the pressure points (on the forehead and cheeks).  Might be OK if you get rest after a few minutes but in pickup games that lasts for a while, you don't get a breather to take the mask off.  The other problem is when I bring the ball up before my shot, the mask is so far off my face it gets in the way.  It's happened on multiple occasions where forget about the mask as I go for an outside shot, I hit my mask with the basketball which throws off my shot resulting in an airball.  I've tried adjusting to this by shooting on the left and right side or shoot from my chest but anyone will tell you varying your shot will lower your accuracy.  Conclusion, the mask offers great protection but would have been great if it fit better.  Because of how narrow it is, it causes problems mentioned above.\",\n \"I am going to agree with every poster who said this game is really easy. I also want to say however that this game looks great and is a lot of fun I just think the downloadable version on the Nintendo Wii looks the best. The game's graphics look absolutely refurbished and redone on the Wii making it look more like a 128 bit game then a 64 bit one. The gameplay is really simplistic once you realize all you have to do in about every level is just eat enough fruit to pass the stage. Like Yoshi's Island before it the challenge isn't in passing each level it's getting a perfect high score. That said, this game may not appeal to Mario purists simply because Mario isn't a playable charachter and the gameplay is  a lot easier than pretty much every Mario game. Once you beat the game there really isn't much to keep you playing it over and over again other than the beautiful graphics. So I rate the graphics a 10 out of 10(10 being the best), the fun 5 out of 10 and the challenge a measly 3 out of 10.\",\n 'Packaging was so nice it surprised me.

The handle would get uncomfortably hot after 10-15 minutes of use. I would have to switch the settings, because it would blow so hot it hurt. This dryer even got so hot, there was a melted edge on one side. The concentrator attachment also would literally blow right off every time I used it. Here it is, about 14 months after purchase (August 2016 is when I bought it), and it now sits in the trash can, waiting to go out with the next garbage pick-up because it's dead.

They definitely do the job, as plowing my nasty, switchback style driveway was dangerous at best prior to getting them. They appear yo be well-made and my prediction is that they should stand the test of time.\\n\\nThe reason I'm taking away two stars is that, 1) Despite the negative reviews, this item still shows the picture for the 2-link spacing. They have at least updated the description, but when I bought the chains, it was not obvious. I was really disappointed when I opened the package... doubly so when I realized they did not come with the rubber tensioners that every other set of chains I've purchased have come with. Ir should be no issue for the company to have two separate listings instead of being lazy and using one set of pics for both. It makes me wonder if it is not intentional... 2) They are pretty difficult to install tightly. They do kink up quite a bit, and even after installing (using a pair of pliers to make the latch as tight as possible), they still required multiple adjustments to make tight enough to not rattle/shift while in use. This difficult installation completely eliminates the possibility of removing them when not needed. I will not be removing these until winter is over, effectively limiting the use of my ATV in good weather, or going over 25-30mph.\\n\\nOverall, they are good chains for the price, but the seller needs to revise their product page and throw in a set of $5 tensioners, at the bare minimum.\",\n 'Elf came on time and was brand new.',\n 'My Lady Compelled is the first book in The Archangels series.

While many of the songs are not what I would term \"artistic masterpieces\" (a few are), it is a very fun album to listen to, and ultimately, isn\\'t that why we listen to music? I was thoroughly entertained by the album, and feel that it is laughable some believe this album marked a decline in Wonder\\'s illustrious career.\\n\\nThere is a notion out there, that unless Stevie releases something which tops \"Songs in the Key of Life\", it is not innovative. I find that notion nonsensical. If \"Characters\" were to be released before \"Talking Book\", people would likely be lauding it as brilliant. I ask those who believe Stevie lost his zest and magical touch in the latter part of his career, what do you wish he would do in order to be on the cutting edge? Should he create a new instrument, or perhaps play in the key of life, instead of the key of C? I feel that if he produced his music the same as he did in the 70\\'s, he would be accused of getting stale, so he adjusted to the 80\\'s as he saw fit; I feel he did a first-class job in that transition.\\n\\nNow that I got my rant out of the way, lets move on to the album. Before I bought all of Wonder\\'s albums, I had the 4 disc box set, \"At the Close of a Century\". I was always enthralled by the song \"You Will Know\", and feel that is on par with any of his previous work, it is truly an extraordinary song. \"With Each Beat Of My Heart\" is an underrated slow/mid tempo ballad; I thought it was great, and then Stevie played his harmonious Harmonica, taking it to the next level. It is followed by \"One of a Kind\", which contains another beautiful Harmonica solo. \"Skeletons\", \"Galaxy Paradise\", and \"My Eyes Don\\'t Cry\" are other favorites of mine. The duet with Michael Jackson, \"Get It\", while good, was not something I particularly loved; I felt like it was an attempt just to capitalize on Jackson\\'s popularity at the time. While the Jackson collaboration was decent at best, \"Come Let Me Make Your Love Come Down\", with  B.B. King & Stevie Ray Vaughan, was extremely well done.\\n\\nOverall, this album has a few songs that belong on a \"Best Of Stevie Wonder\" list, and many others that are catchy and enjoyable listens. In fact, I have quite a few of them stuck in my head as I write this review. I always felt a Stevie Wonder CD was a safe buy, and this one is no different. I cannot see how one can walk away from this album dissatisfied, especially if you enjoy Wonder\\'s work. While this CD can sound quite \"poppy\" in spots, many songs have that distinct 80\\'s sound, it clearly has Wonder\\'s fingerprints (or tips), all over it, and lucky for us listeners, he is a musical genius.',\n 'The quality of the tissue is very good.

The container can hold more than the 50 we used, though I suppose it would depend on how much thread you put on each individual bobbin. The bobbins inside are flat, meant to store embroidery floss while you complete a project or between projects. The bobbins have tabs to tuck the floss in and hold it as you start to wind and then to hold the end when you are finished winding so the thread stays on the bobbin until you are ready to take it off- no unraveling. They fit well into the compartmentalized sections and the lid will close whether you have the tab side up or the thread side up. There is a larger section that will hold a small embroidery scissors and needles. The clear package makes it easy to see the contents even when closed. Does it take time to wind the floss? Yes. But trying to unravel one thread from a knotted mess of floss also takes time, and winding is a lot less frustrating. Once organized, you can enjoy your project knowing that whatever thread you'll need next will be easy to find and remove. It took me only an hour or so in front of a movie to fill all 50 bobbins. The lid closes nice and tight, so there is little chance of spilling. I crumpled the paper on the front of the lid before I realized it had an organizational chart on the back. I don't think I would have used it anyway, but now you know it's there so you won't make my mistake. I wrote the floss ID numbers in sharpie on the side of each bobbin where the tabs are and put them in the organizer in ascending order left to right. My daughter had thread hanging from every available surface in her room to try and keep a rather large cross-stitch project organized and the thread untangled, so I was thrilled to find this organizer.\",\n \"Read reviews first!

Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band\" is far from the conceptual, free-flowing image it may project. In fact, it could be argued that the Beatles\\' eighth studio album is a bit choppy in spots, with little rhyme or reason in terms of subject and sound. Nonetheless, the band should be commended for its studio experimentation and range of diverse noises within each unique song. What started as a potentially gimmicky idea by Paul McCartney, in the eyes of his three band mates, ended up being a critically acclaimed and monumental release by an already larger-than-life band from the 1960s.\\n\\nPaul\\'s idea was to record music as the Beatles but release the new album under the band name Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Accompanying the slaved-over music -- which would take five months to perfect in the studio -- was a splashy album cover and bonus Beatles paraphernalia that was included with the record to satiate salivating Beatles fans, many of whom felt the band had become way too isolated for its own good by the time the Summer of Love rolled around in 1967.\\n\\nThe first three songs on \"Sgt. Pepper\\'s\" are alone worth the price of admission, and at the start, it does indeed feel like a concept album. True to the album\\'s intent, the enthusiastic title-track opener, sung with gusto by McCartney, feels like the beginning of something fresh, spunky and experimental. In some ways, it IS like listening to a band other than the Beatles. Far from being farcical, as some of the other Beatles may have feared, McCartney\\'s infectiousness is contagious at the start. Interestingly, the following song, \"With a Little Help from My Friends,\" sung mournfully by Ringo Starr, is an entirely different entity; it stands as a perfect come-down, a warning that not all is bliss on the record.\\n\\nThe hazy atmosphere of drugs abounds on this album, starting with the eerie, isolated and high-pitched keyboard on \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" Though the song eventually emerges into a tuneful sing-along, Lennon\\'s equally filtered and unnatural voice and lyrics are in lock step with the trippy images he dreamily sings about. Though his contributions to \"Sgt. Pepper\\'s\" were invaluable, Lennon was said to be drugged to the max during its creation, at times nearly catatonic in nature. By contrast, his cohort McCartney, though also partaking heavily in his share of \"downers,\" warmed up for numerous \"Sgt. Pepper\\'s\" sessions with cocaine, paving the way for a remarkable contrast in moods, singing styles and attitudes throughout the record\\'s journey.\\n\\nSome of this stuff is pure Beatles pop, conventional and safe. \"Getting Better,\" for instance, was at one time featured in TV commercials (for a TV brand, I think). Though the lyrics on \"Getting Better\" are surprisingly introspective and frank (\"I used to be cruel to my woman/I\\'d beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved\"), the sound is upbeat, familiar and friendly. Elsewhere, McCartney is positively stately sounding on such gems as the beautiful \"She\\'s Leaving Home,\" the upbeat \"Lovely Rita\" and the innocent-sounding \"When I\\'m Sixty-Four.\"\\n\\nA few laborious swerves on the record include Lennon\\'s somewhat contrived-sounding \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\" and George Harrison\\'s droning, sitar-laced \"Within You Without You,\" which, to its credit, does include a pertinent message about the ultimate unimportance and mortality of humans. Though Harrison\\'s tune strives for a never-ending deepness, a far more interesting and trippy time occurs on the epic Lennon/McCartney closer, \"A Day in the Life,\" which smoothly veers from Lennon\\'s faraway annunciations (\"I read the news today, oh boy\") to McCartney\\'s snappy dialogue (\"Woke up, got out of bed, dragged a comb across my head).\\n\\nUndoubtedly, from top to bottom, \"Sgt. Pepper\\'s\" boasts innovative sounds from the Beatles that helped change the musical landscape. Trumpets and piano usurp Harrison\\'s feisty guitar licks; Lennon shows up in a fog; Ringo obediently lends his hand; and much of the project has a movielike feel, thanks to McCartney\\'s bountiful energy and producer George Martin\\'s studio mastery.',\n \"As part of a promotion for buying this item, BoxWave was supposed to also send you a screen protector.

A friend of mine has a Kodak DC3400 2 megapixel camera that takes great pics, so I thought this one would be even better. What a mistake!\\nThis is my second digital camera. My first was a Canon A5 (quite a dinosaur now!). I was considering another Canon, but I was lured into the price of this one....\\nAt first I was pretty pleased with it. The menu is very simple. All of the settings, pretty much, only require a \"yes or no\" answer. This was much more simple than some of the settings on my Canon.\\nI\\'m not very pleased with the pictures themselves, though. The redeye reduction is HORRIBLE. Both of my sons look posessed in most of the pictures I take. Their eyes glow this BRIGHT, VIBRANT RED. To the point that they can\\'t even be corrected with software. The pictures aren\\'t always clear. The color, if the lighting isn\\'t ideal, sometimes tends to look a bit \"blah\". Even on my old 1mp Canon, I could still get these bright, lucious colors! With this one, the colors almost look like they bleed together sometimes.\\nThe batteries are another issue. I was pretty pleased with the battery that came with the camera. It lasted for a very signifigant amount of time (maybe 2 or 3 months with fairly frequent use). But once those died, I tried some regular alkalines. These were/are a joke. I maybe got 2 weeks use out of them. And I\\'m not much of an LCD viewer myself, so I know that wasn\\'t sucking the life out of them.\\nThe 8 meg Compact Flash card the ship with the camera is an absolute JOKE. If you get this camera, be prepared to spend [more money] on a new compact flash card. Just go ahead and thow it in your amazon.com cart and add it to the total price of the camera! And while you\\'re at it, you might also consider throwing in the rechargable batteries and the charger, because you\\'ll spend a small fortune if you want to use regular AA\\'s.\\nAs I said in the beginning of this review, I am very disappointed in this camera. Unfortunately, it took me almost 2 months to come to the realization that I had made a mistake when I purchased it. Now I am stuck with it. I do not recommend it. I feel that I would\\'ve been better off getting a high rated 2 megapixel camera. Unless you\\'re willing to spend the extra cash for a good 4 MP, the 3 MP isn\\'t worth the extra cash. A 4 MP camera is almost the equivilant (sp?) of a 35mm anyways. So a 3.1 mp is still shy of that goal.\\nGood luck in choosing! I think mine might end up finding it\\'s way to an auction site. It\\'s a perfectly functioning camera, it just doesn\\'t live up to my own personal expectations.',\n \"Don't waste your money! I had this on a locker and it was broken off and my stuff was stolen.

I downloaded some of my pdf files, checked my email, got on the web, and got a couple of reading materials from the Nook store....then I looked at the apps selection of the B&N store -- jeeze, very limited.  I had read multiple enthusiastic reviews talking about downloading third party apps, went online and was very happy to download several of the same apps I use on my smart phone that are not available on the B&N store.  I got a few apps, sideloaded them, and was happy.  At this point I would say I would have given 4.5 stars if I reviewed it right then and even told my friends and patients the same.  Then I turned on my NT right before Christmas, and the third party app capability had disappeared.  I discovered that the 1.4.1 firmware update that was pushed to us unsuspecting users had disabled the capability of third party apps.  Talk about disappointed -- The main reasons I got the NT (instead of a Kindle Fire) were #1 the android OS that allows you to run literally thousands of apps, and #2 the memory card expansion slot.  Now, with third party apps locked out, the NT in my eyes has significantly lost value, in fact it really isn\\'t much more than an eReader now -- and I could have spent a lot less and got either a black/white version or nook color if an eReader is all I wanted.  It was marketed as a \"Nook Tablet\" and that is what I expected when I bought it.  Now I am really thinking hard about taking it back.  Nook \"tablet\" my foot - without decent apps, this thing is basically a nook color that costs a lot more.  This is a totally bone headed move on B&N\\'s part, and very draconian.  I understand that they want users to buy content from them instead of a competitor  -- OK, fine, but how about offering some content in terms of apps that I want or need? What about free apps from other sources that you wouldn\\'t make money on anyway? What about the apps I already paid for via the android store that I use on my smart phone, that I am allowed by their EULA to put on more than 1 device, say my NT plus my smart phone? I would love to put some of those apps on my NT, but either B&N wants me to buy another copy from them now just to use on my Nook, or I am just SOL if they don\\'t have it available in their store.  How many times do I really need to pay for Angry Birds?  Do you think people buy MP3s from iTunes, then turn around and buy the same MP3s from Google, then turn around and buy the same MP3s from Amazon?  Well, then why should B&N insist that you do?  I don\\'t have a huge issue with them steering customers back to them, if they just offered more selection in their app store.  Have a look at the android market - I think they have over 50,000 apps, Look at the Amazon app store -- over 24,000 apps (many free) -- I know that is their competitor, but they need to improve their own selection if they want to keep me as a customer.  They have basically said to their customers you buy from us, or you buy from no one.  You lock people down, you tell them you only buy from one source (B&N) and then offer a pittance when compared to your competition, and even charge for some apps that are free elsewhere, or charge for apps the customer has already bought somewhere else previously, then don\\'t be surprised when customers leave you for other products.  The Nook has superior hardware, but it doesn\\'t mean Jack if you can\\'t have the software you need/want in order to utilize the hardware -- like I said I\\'ll probably take it back to the store.  I\\'d rather have a Kindle Fire or true android Tablet so that I can use the software I want to use.  And now when my friends and patients ask, I am now telling them to buy something else where you can actually use the software you want - I have totally came around 180 since the B&N \"update\" stripped one of the best capabilities out of the Nook Tablet.

However, I find that it's a very subtle album.  I notice something new every time I listen to it, and it has begun to grow  on me.  The music is technically superior to Serpentine Gallery, most  likely due to the fact that they are now more accomplished musicians, and  the fact that they have added a live drummer.  The overall sound is much  cleaner and more finished-sounding.  They've also gone with a much  different sound, part of why it took me so long to like it.  However, if  you take the album on its own merit, and don't try to compare it to  Serpentine Gallery (one of my all-time favorites, and hard to beat), it  really is an excellent piece of work.  I hesitate to give it more than 3  stars simply because I DON'T feel it's as good as Serpentine (down to 4  stars there), and also due to the fact that I really am still listening to  it, and that it's taken me so long to appreciate it (down to 3).  It's  almost too subtle for its own good, since a lot of listeners will listen to  it once or twice, decide that it's Bad Trash (sorry, couldn't help it), and  never listen to it again.

For fans of Mario and fighting games, this is for you.\",\n 'I had got into the \"Sim\" games by playing SimTower and I loved that game, and it got me into those kinds of games. I saw SC3K in stores and read about it on the back of the box, and it looked neat. I bought it  and I was truly excited when I started playing, it was one of the best  games that I had ever seen in my life! After that, I had decided to get the  SC2K demo, just out of curiosity, to see what that\\'s like. As I was playing  the demo of SC2K, I was very disapointed because it was very weak compared  to SC3K, and when I saw so many people complaining about this being just  like SC2K, I was puzzled. I hated SC2K because: the graphics were weak, I  couldn\\'t even get the city started because people wouldn\\'t move in, they\\'re  are very little options to control what your city looked like, and the  power plants wouldn\\'t even power a tiny little city! I think that SC3K was  a wonderful change from SC2K.\\nAnyways, I thought that SC3K was a very  interesting and entertaining game. Not one of those games where you shoot  as much people as you can, this a game where yoiu plan out a city and watch  it grow, you really had to think while building your city. I have made 3  cities right now that have covered the whole terrain, each with a different  theme (I called them Porcelina, New York 2, and El Golde). This game took  me into another world, and you really care about your sims and your city.  The graphics are spectacular! You can see all of your sims (by the way,  sims are people) and you can see cars in traffic jams or alone on the  roads. Another great thing is how you can control the way you want your  city to look like, unlike in SC2K. I love how you can shape the terrain in  your city better than SC2K. I also think that it\\'s very neat how you can  put landmarks in your city and you can pick real city terrain to build a  city. If your one of those people who like games that you just kill a bunch  of people, than this is NOT the game for you, but if you like intelligent  games that make you think and entertain you at the same time, than this is  the game for you. Don\\'t get SC2K, get SC3K! :)',\n 'At the risk of being a lone voice in the wilderness,\\nI feel like enough time has passed for \"Sgt. Pepper\"\\nto receive an objective musical assessment, free from\\nthe hyperbole and hype that have surrounded it ever\\nsince its initial release in the Spring of 1967. To\\nbegin with, this \"original\" concept album took as its\\ntemplate, Brian Wilson\\'s watershed opus \"Pet Sounds\",\\nreleased by the Beach Boys in 1966. Despite the fact\\nthat Paul McCartney has openly admitted this fact\\nnumerous times in the music press, The Beatles are\\nunfairly being credited with pioneering something\\nthey clearly did not invent. In terms of continuity,\\nSide One flows meticulously from the neo-garage of the\\ntitle track, to the Tin-Pan Alley musings of \"With A\\nLittle Help From My Friends\" to John Lennon\\'s deserved\\npsych-pop masterpiece \"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.\"\\n\"Getting Better\" follows, still rife with pop overtones,\\nbut lyrically covers some dark territory: \"I used to be\\ncruel to my woman/I beat her, and kept her apart from\\nthe things that she loved..\" It leads into McCartney\\'s\\nsweetly introspective \"Fixing A Hole\" and then into\\nSide One\\'s true revelation, the quietly majestic \"She\\'s\\nLeaving Home.\" A truly discerning listener will cite\\nthis track as a textbook example of how The Beatles\\nappropriated Wilson\\'s genius, from their vocal harmonies\\nright down to the orchestral arrangement. Side One ends\\nwith the charming novelty \"Being For The Benefit of Mr.\\nKite\", a tune that could easily have been a throwaway, if\\nnot for Lennon\\'s cheeky delivery, and the trippy sonic\\nflourishes peppered throughout. Side Two however, is a\\ndifferent story. The fact is, despite its Middle Eastern\\nambience (or more likely, because of it) George Harrison\\'s\\nmesmerizing \"Within You, Without You\" feels strangely out\\nof place here. McCartney follows this with two of his most\\nboilerplate compositions to date: the so-cloying-it-should-\\nbe-an-AARP-jingle \"When I\\'m Sixty Four\" and the awkward\\npop-funk of \"Lovely Rita\", which is nearly saved by its\\nintriguing instrumental ending. And in retrospect, however\\ngroundbreaking the three-part suite \"A Day In The Life\"\\nseemed in 1967, listening to it now I see its musical\\nambition far exceeded its actual execution. As a example\\nof a 60\\'s concept-album that succeeded on aesthetic terms\\nalone (and not the rock-hype frenzy) I\\'d recommend \"Pet\\nSounds\" by The Beach Boys, \"Sell Out\" by The Who, or the\\nlesser-known but equally brilliant \"SF Sorrow\" by The Pretty\\nThings. I realize nothing I\\'ve said here will ever change the\\njournalistic mythology that envelops \"Sgt. Pepper\", but that\\ndoesn\\'t mean such reservations shouldn\\'t finally see the\\nlight of day - for crying out loud, its been almost forty\\nfreakin\\' years, people!',\n \"I ordered the Small for my teen daughter.

I guess I wanted to see if the game lived up to the controversy.\\n  It does.  Soldier of Fortune is a typical First Person Shooter, about a \\'one man army\\' who fights his way through level after level of enemies that look exactly the same.  Aside from the extremely graphic violence, you wouldn\\'t be able to tell this game apart from any other mediocre corridor shooter.  But the violence is very, very graphic.  Heads are split apart, limbs are torn off, intestines and chunks of various other organs protrude from gaping wounds.  It is all an attempt to portray violence \\'realistically\\' in a videogame, but after a short period of time it all seems too over-the-top and very unnecessary.  Regardless of whether or not the developers were trying to make the game realistic, blood and gore should probably be a bit more limited than this.\\n  So aside from this \\'gimmick\\' the rest of the game is very average.

It has a two month lifespan, which is perfectly adequate for figuring out whether you will like the product or not. I've spent the last two days mucking around with it and I really like what I see. I like the 'dashboard' functionality where you set up all your account details, portfolios etc, and then Money will tell you which stocks are doing well, doing badly etc. I am very wary of linking bank accounts directly into the internet, so in the meantime I'm just downloading stock information. It is a bit limited on the international stocks side, and the US product is (surprise surprise) catered for US tax law and US investments (eg: 401K). But I would expect that this would all come in handy for someone actually from the US. The best functionality in this product is definitely the dashboard, cash flow and budgeting facilities. Basically every time I log into Money, it updates itself with the latest Money updates (ie: patches etc) and stock values, and tells me at a glance how everything is going. I'd give it five stars, but there are minor gaps in the functionality - like you can't import historical share data if the share isn't on the MSN listings. But this is very minor. It is definitely designed for you to set up all your accounts, all your shares and bonds, set up all the links into the internet to get current prices/values/balances, and then periodically monitor and update as you require. I'm not planning on using all the functionality, but what I have seen is very neat indeed. Up until now, I have managed such information in Word or Excel.

I will refrain from repeating the stirring story, which served as a foundation for Hicks\\' novel, as this has already been done by the other reviewers. Instead, I want to focus on the points which made me upset and angry. The author tends to take too many liberties with the historical figures thus leaving a sour taste in the mouth of the informed reader. If he  intended to create \"composites\" of the great people who really lived ( as he claimed at the end of the book) \"in the interest of telling the story,\" he should have changed their names. Otherwise, he should have adhered to the accurate and factual representation of their characters and actions. Carrie McGavock would be rolling over in her grave if she read this about herself, and Gen N.B. Forrest is sketched as a brute twisted in body and mind. The latter appears to be in line with the modern day politically correct propaganda. As most people receive their information about history from novels and movies, not from memoirs, biographies, and the like, they will carry in their minds permanently distorted perceptions of historical facts and figures. Books like this do more harm than good. Besides, I found something vaguely repellent about Hicks\\' story and many of its details until I could no longer take it. Despite the author\\'s seemingly noble intentions (portrayal of a patriotic and self-abnegating woman), his book is geared towards a particular agenda working on the subconscious level.

Once I got my daughter calmed down (she has both a bump and a bruise on her forehead from this toy) I looked it over myself and tried to reattach it.\\n\\nThis thing is HAZARDOUS.  The straps are just a piece of plastic crap; they are supposed to slide through the back of the toy, loop over the crib, and hook onto a plastic tab on the back of the strap.  Seriously people, I tried it front ways and backwards, tried attaching it criss-cross, (AFTER following the Vtech instructions on how to attach it) and no matter which way I threaded the straps or how I attached it, it would let go on it's own, or with just the slightest jiggle to the crib.\\n\\nBeing 14 months old, my daughter has had her fair share of bumps and bruises already, but I couldn't stop thinking about what if she'd been an infant, and she'd kicked the crib or rolled into it, or I'd bumped it while checking on her and this thing could have plunged the whole distance of the crib to slam into her face/head.\\n\\nI'm really displeased.

In this live rendition- the essence of the song is very well audibly felt as a bluesy track, which segued into the song \\'G.L.O.R.I.A.\\' - not their track from their 1981 sophomore album OCTOBER, but rather by their fellow countrymen veteran recording artists Van Morrison & The Chieftains.\\n\\n* `Where the Streets Have No Name\\' = the very track that\\'s used for its movie trailer (included on the dvd) where the band is seen entering the stage (and the first shot to bring the concert footages in colour) presented in slow motion for the trailer; and also there\\'s the live rendition of their chart topper `With Or Without You\\'; plus their epic ballad from the same JOSHUA TREE album `Running To Stand Still\\', and a great heavier rock live rendition of \\'In God\\'s Country\\' against it\\'s atmospherical country-ish studio version which appeared in the said album.\\n\\n* A performance of their song \\'Mlk\\' and \\'Bad\\' from their 1984 lp THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, that didn\\'t level in any way close to their classic performance of the song that appeared in their 1985 4- tracked ep (consisting of a pair of studio outakes and one of the couple live tracks from the said album), WIDE AWAKE IN AMERICA - that rather turned as a curio when Bono perhaps on an absent-minded impromptu impulse sang a pair of ROLLING STONE songs by the end of it - seguing to \\'Ruby Tuesday\\', (which went quite incoherently to the theme of the song), and most peculiarly \\' Sympathy For the Devil\\' - that seem to tell the song \\'Bad\\' is rather spoken under the perspective of the so-called virtue-istic sentiments by no other than Satan himself! Perhaps just an incidental quirk, or perhaps an intentional pun of sorts coming out from Bono- who years after donned the McPhisto-devil alter ego persona of his against the Fly, who stands to symbolize egotistic arrogance in its persona, being that Bono had the knack for \\'tourrette\\' psyche, flaunting whatever criticism or comment that\\'s thrown the band; which I guess is also the responsible driving factor for U2 to turn techno-pop, almost to a point that\\'s as scary to sound nearly a lot like the pop music of Michael Jackson.\\nHowever, on the RATTLE AND HUM lp, there\\'s that track called `God part 2\\' - an antithesis for John Lennon\\'s track which appeared on his 1970 debut album PLASTIC ONO BAND - a song which state that Lennon only believes in himself and his wife Yoko Ono against NOT believing anything or anyone else - whence the U2 song went to state \"I don\\'t believe the Devil, I don\\'t believe his book... I believe in love.\"\\n\\n* \\'Sunday Bloody Sunday\\' = When I first saw this then, I got a little peeved rather than blown away when they played this perennial track o\\'theirs - seeing that Bono appeared to\\'ve tried to force himself in trying to move the audiences with his anger-filled rhetoric regarding the revolution on their homeland of Ireland. Bono did stated however before the segment is shown that they almost never did included this said segment in the film- thinking that many are not likely to comprehend or relate to the grievances that they are expressing regarding the Irish\\'s plight about Ireland\\'s political struggles; which is followed up by their performance of \\'Pride (In The Name Of Love)\\' that wrapped up the flick- with the song \\'All I Want Is You\\' playing in the background as the end credit rolls up.\\n\\nThe portion for `The Star Spangled Banner\\' which opened up their performance of `Bullet the Blue Sky\\' actually happens to be the very same Jimi Hendrix rendition that appeared in WOODSTOCK - quite a bit of a feat that\\'s not different from what peeved George Harrison regarding the band in filming their video for `Where The Streets Have No Name\\' on top of a roof, as its been done before; in this case Hendrix\\'s performance of the American anthem\\'s been used on the opening for Neil Young\\'s great concert movie RUST NEVER SLEEPS. The movie, although containing a number of tracks that appeared as well from its lp companion did have some of those tracks as different versions to those that appeared in the album- such as `Angel of Harlem\\', `Love Rescue Me\\' and ` Desire\\', which are live studio sessions, that on the latter the band lengthened the refrain of the song stamping some pun about traveling-preachers (which also went as the same case from a line on the narration portions of their performance for `Bullet the Blue Sky\\'); and the full live rendition of `I Still Haven\\'t Found What I\\'m Looking For\\' (which is on the album) only appeared here as a segment, wherein the song is being practiced by the band with the gospel choir on a small community chapel (with tolerant looks on the faces of the Christian choir- perhaps seeing that there\\'s no real Christian message in the song).\\nOverall, although some had dismissed this whole documentary movie feature as merely a whole lotta nothing but some \"pRattle and Hum-bug\" from U2 -- it\\'s quite one of the finest music films about a band ever filmed.\\n\\nNo flags are waved.\\n\\nRATE: 8 out of 10',\n \"This used to be a really good magazine - worth the $20-$25 per year - probably 5 years ago.

It spreads the cut grass evenly so there\\'s no need to rake afterwards. I\\'ve never seen a mower, gas, electric or reel, that spreads the clippings better than this one. And leaving the clippings is good for the health of your lawn.\\n\\nBut having a lawn that grows evenly is hard to come by. Whenever I tried to push the mower trough grass chunks taller than 4 inches I had to run so it didn\\'t stop me. And even that, most of the time I came to a complete stop. I step back and forward again and stopped by the 5\" of grass chunk. This reel mower DOES NOT go trough grass taller than 4\" unless you and 3 other people push it. You will end-up extremely tired and will have to do a second pass with a trimer.\\n\\nBelieve me when I tell you that you will use it once, love the results, use it a second time and decide to buy a regular lawn mower.\\n\\nNOTE: DON\\'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT.

There is a lag of a second or two between opening the boom to answer the call and the headset actually connecting to the phone.

Strange days indeed...\",\n 'Of all the music orientated magazines that I subscribe, Outburn is my personal favorite. This is the only magazine that caters to my favorite music...techno, goth, and industrial music. Rolling Stone stopped being relevant 10 years ago. Spin magazine is a joke. Alternative Press is also a joke and has stopped being relevant many, many moons ago. I discovered Outburn when I saw an article on one of my personal favorite bands of all time, VNV Nation. Rolling Stone, Spin, and AP wouldn\\'t touch VNV Nation with a ten foot pole because it isn\\'t popular with the brainwashed masses. That was last year. Since then, I have been a loyal reader as well as a loyal subscriber to the quarterly magazine. What appeals to me the most about Outburn is that the magazine covers more than just goth and industrial music but also lesser known metal bands like Lacuna Coil and Opeth. I\\'m not a metal fan by a long shot but it is refreshing to read a magazine in which heavy metal bands are the [pooh] that MTV and Clear Channel, er, radio plays non-stop (i.e Korn, Deftones, Limp Bizkit). Outburn covers lesser known metal bands that MTV wouldn\\'t dare play except maybe on the new incarnation of \"Headbanger\\'s Ball\". I also enjoy the original questions the writers throws at the artists and bands they interview. They also don\\'t sound patronizing or condescending one bit. And unlike Spin magazine which has now become a forum for video games and fashion as opposed to music, Outburn sticks to what it knows best which is music. Although Marilyn Manson is on the cover of the new issue of Outburn, at least I can be grateful that the editors didn\\'t throw Good Charlotte on the cover. Another thing I love about Outburn is the free cd offer for subscribers. Nothing beats like a free cd and for less than ten dollars. One of the problems I have with Outburn is that it is a quarterly magazine, not a monthly magazine. I wish that rags like AP, Spin, and RS were quarterly magazines. I also wish that they covered less death metal and punk bands nad cover more synthpop/EBM acts like they did a few years when I first started reading the magazine (thanks to the VNV Nation article). I really don\\'t want to see Outburn turn into something wretched like \"Alternative Press\" did over the years with the pseudo punk movement. Outburn is now endanger of becoming like AP but instead with death metal bands. I am lucky to even read one lousy article about an artist/band that is geared towards my taste (synthpop, EBM, industrial, goth, darkwave). I like reading the record reviews but even they are starting to look stale like the rest of the magazine.',\n 'Disappointed!! Not true to size!

The conversation between the speaker and his dead friend sounded as though it was a couple of young teens talking (although the topic fit an adult conversation), both parties kept repeating the same sentences over and over again. This was not due to editing, it was simply how the story was written. Dialogue can either make or break a story and in this case, it was the latter.
